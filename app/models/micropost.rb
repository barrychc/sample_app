                         WHERE follower_id = :user_id"

    where("user_id IN (?) OR user_id = ?", followed_user_ids, user)

Here the followed_user_ids method is synthesized by Active Record based on the
has_many :followed_users association (Listing 11.10); the result is that we
need only append _ids to the association name to get the ids corresponding to
the "user.followed_users" collection.	

user.followed_user_ids = user.followed_users.map(&:id)

the same method (e.g., to_s) gets called on each element, are common enough that
thereâ€™s a shorthand notation using an ampersand & and a symbol corresponding to the method
[1, 2, 3, 4].map { |i| i.to_s }
[1, 2, 3, 4].map(&:to_s)

For bigger sites, you would probably need to generate the feed asynchronously
using a background job. Such scaling subtleties are beyond the scope of this
tutorial, but the Scaling Rails screencasts are a good place to start.
